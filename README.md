# Drug-Discovery

On-going personal project that combines professional experiences to searche online sources for specific protein targets to explore vaccine candidates in a research setting. I hope to be able to apply machine learning tools to develop this project further. 

In this project I do the following: <br>
part 1: target a specific protein search <br> 
part 2: collect the data set <br>
part 3: collect bioactivity data <br>
part 4: process the unique data <br>
part 5: focus the data <br>
