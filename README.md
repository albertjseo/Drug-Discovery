# Drug-Discovery

On-going personal project that applies machine learning to current professional experiences to explore vaccine candidates in a research setting.

I hope to do the following:
  part 1: target protein serach --> collect data set --> bioactivity data --> data processing --> focused data
  part 2: exploratory data analysis
  part 3: Descriptor calculation
  part 4: Modeling 
  part 5: Model Comparison
  part 6: performance comparison 
  part 7: deploy model
